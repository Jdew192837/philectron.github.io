Hello. I've just bought my new LaunchPad. Today, I'm going to log my progress on lab 08 of this course - LEDs and Switches. This is the first lab that we are going to interface LEDs and switches. Breadboard also appears for the first time in this course. I'm excited to get into the mixture of electronics and programming.

## **OVERVIEW:**

First, I'll summarize what I've learned in chapter 8.

1. **Switch:**<br>
  For more information about the switch, see its [datasheet](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/blob/master/data_sheets/omron_b3f_tactile_switch.pdf).<br>
  ![switch](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-08/switch.jpg)

2. **Pull-up resistor vs. Pull-down resistor & Positive logic vs. Negative logic:**<br>
  This is the main idea of this chapter. We will dig into the relationship between electronics and logic.<br>
  ![pull-up-and-pull-down-resistors](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-08/pull-up-and-pull-down-resistors.jpg)<br>
  A **pull-up resistor** is connected to the power-supply voltage **(VCC)** and represents **negative logic**, whereas a **pull-down resistor** is connected to ground **(GND)** and represents **positive logic**.<br>
  However, what are positive logic and negative logic?<br>
  ![positive-and-negative-logic](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-08/positive-and-negative-logic.jpg)<br>
  Remember, the LaunchPad **always** reads `0 = open` and `1 = closed`.

3. **Floating state and how to prevent it:**<br>
  When the switch is closed, the LaunchPad will read 1. When the switch is open, the LaunchPad looks like it's reading 0. However, it's not exactly 0. It's "float".<br>
  To prevent "float", we need to look up the datasheet of the microcontroller. I forgot where I got it, but I learned that the current limit for I/O pins is 2 microamps, and the pin will read from 0V - 0.8V as negligible. Let the voltage read in when the switch is open be 0.02V. According to Ohm's law, **we have to put a 10-kilohm resistor as a pull-down resistor to make the switch work as a positive logic.**

4. **LED Interface:**<br>
  Read the LED's [data sheet](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/blob/master/data_sheets/avago_hlmp_leds.pdf) before attempting to do anything to it.<br>
  ![led](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-08/led.jpg)<br>
  Each LED has an operating point at which it operates at maximum efficiency. Knowing the operating point helps us to put the right value of resistor for the LED and prevent it from becoming a firework on a 3.3V circuit.<br>
  To calculate the right value of a resistor for the LED,<br>
  ![led-operating-point](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-08/led-operating-point.jpg)<br>
  **In this lab, we need a 500-ohm resistor to make the LED work properly, but using a 470-ohm resistor is good enough.**

5. Next, let's talk about a **design example**. There are 6 steps: Requirements Document, Data Flow Graph, Code Flow Charts, Building the Software, Testing in the Simulation, and Testing on the Real Board. That's all we need to know.

Let's build the circuit!

## **PARTS:**

- 1 x EK-TM4C123GXL

![ek-tm4c123gxl](/images/ek-tm4c123gxl.jpg)

- 1 x Breadboard

![breadboard](/images/breadboard.jpg)

- 1 x 470-ohm resistor
- 1 x 10-kilohm resistor
- 1 x LED (I chose red)
- 1 x Switch
- 5 x Jumper wires

## **BREADBOARD LAYOUT:**

Because Fritzing doesn't have a part for EK-TM4C123GXL, I'll draw the schematic on paper.

![circuit-paperwork](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-08/circuit-paperwork.jpg)

Here is the real board layout:

![breadboard-layout](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-08/breadboard-layout.jpg)

## **CODE:**

Note that to be able to run and grade the labs, you have to follow the [software requirements](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/blob/master/software_requirements.pdf). Unfortunately, the software and the course don't support Linux. However, if you follow the official instruction from [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/LaunchPad/software.html#tabs), you can upload and run your program on the LaunchPad.

See below for my full code, or view it on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/tree/master/lab_08_switch_led_interface).

Lab 8 is the first lab we work on the breadboard, so it's very interesting. In the next post, I'll come up with my tips on the `Delay()` function. Thanks for reading!
