I've been away for how long? Two months? That's a lot. At the beginning of the year, I got college and scholarship applications that needed to complete. Then since March, I've been really busy with Advanced Placement exams. I'm taking 4 exams this year in order to try to achieve my _AP Scholar with Distinction_ ambition.

So, I'm still alive and well, but I'm too busy to keep posting blogs regularly. I'll also be away in during May. I'm having lots of projects in my mind right now, but I don't have time to post them here.

I'll be back at the end of May, hopefully...
