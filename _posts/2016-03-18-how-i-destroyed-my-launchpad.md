Yes. I destroyed it. That's on me.

I didn't read the data sheet carefully about the functionality of each pin on the LaunchPad.

I didn't cut off the power when I wired the circuit.

I think the ICDI Device was destroyed.

More importantly, I think I didn't wire a DC motor to the LaunchPad properly, which led to its execution.

I gotta buy a new LaunchPad. $13 helped my learn many things.
