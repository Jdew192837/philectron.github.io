## **OVERVIEW:**

Chapter 10 is the most difficult chapter so far. It covers finite-state machine. I have never learned about finite-state machines before, so it was quite challenging for me to let everything sink it.

## **PHASE-LOCK LOOP (PLL):**

PLL allows us to speed up or slow down the clock. There is a trade-off between speed and power: If the clock is sped up, the board can do more works as well as consume more energy. On the other hand, if the clock is slowed down, the board uses less energy, which means it cannot do as many works.

PLL has 2 fields; XTAL and SYSDIV2, which are correspondingly represented by the two registers: `SYSCTL_RCC_R` and `SYSCTL_RCC2_R`.

To config the PLL, we need to config `SYSCTL_RCC_R` and `SYSCTL_RCC2_R` like below:

![pll](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-10/pll.jpg)

PLL gives us 2 things:

1. Higher precision external crystal

2. Flexibility to choose our speed. Again, **slow speed = less power consumption** and **high speed = more power consumption**.

We don't use PLL configuration in this lab, but it is good to know how to configure the PLL and change a 16-MHz clock into a 80-MHz clock. For more detail, visit the [datasheet of the EK-TM4C123GH6PM](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/blob/master/data_sheets/texas%20instruments_tm4c123gh6pm.pdf), **page 1366**.

## **SYSTICK DELAY REVISITED:**

Since the PLL changes the system clock to 80 MHz, each tick will take 12.5ns (or 12.5e-9 seconds or 1.25e-8 seconds) to complete. In order to write a standard SysTick delay function, add the following lines:

```c
/**
 * Delays the program
 *
 * @param  delay  count value
 *
 * @assumption    80-MHz clock
 *
 * @notes         delay = DELAY_TIME_SEC / 12.5 / 0.000000001
 */
void SysTickWait(unsigned long delay) {
    NVIC_ST_RELOAD_R  = delay - 1; // number of counts to wait
    NVIC_ST_CURRENT_R = 0;         // overwrite the CURRENT register

    // wait until COUNT is flagged:
    while ((NVIC_ST_CTRL_R & 0x00010000) == 0) {}
}
```

We would delay the program according to the value of delay: `delay = DELAY_TIME_SEC / 12.5 / 0.000000001`

For example, to delay 1ms (recommended), the delay value would equal to **80000**. Apply the standard delay function using SysTick timer, we can create a precise delay function by delay 1ms a number of times.

```c
/**
 * Delays the program some milliseconds
 *
 * @param  time_ms  milliseconds to delay
 *
 * @assumption          80-MHz clock
 */
void SysTickWait1ms(unsigned long time_ms) {
    unsigned long i;

    for (i = 0; i < time_ms; i++) {
        // count = 0.001 / 12.5 / 0.000000001 = 80000
        // equivalent to 1 millisecond
        SysTick_Wait(80000);
    }
}
```

Lastly, the `COUNT` flag of the SysTick can be cleared by a reading of the register or a writing of any value to the `CURRENT` register. I made a mistake on this because I didn't know that a read of the register can clear the `COUNT` flag. Again, for more information, feel free to read the [datasheet](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/blob/master/data_sheets/texas%20instruments_tm4c123gh6pm.pdf), **page 1366**.

## **STRUCT IN C:**

I suggest visiting [this page](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_structures.htm) to learn structs in C.

We will declare a struct which contains the output, the delay time, and the state transition.

## **FINITE-STATE MACHINES (FSM):**

The most abstract content in this chapter is FSM. To fully describe an FSM, we need **5 things**:

1. Set of inputs
2. Set of outputs
3. Set of states
4. State transition graphs or matrix
5. Output determination

There are two well-known types of FSM, which are **Moore FSM** and **Mealy FSM**.

Instead of if statement, FSM use arrays containing different states to branch the flow of code. The application of the FSM will be mentioned below.

By the way, I also learned a new thing from the quiz of the chapter on SysTick Timer. Since SysTick is a 24-bit timer, **the longest time** one can wait for it is: `2^24 * 12.5 nanoseconds = 0.2097152 seconds`.

If an FSM has **n digital inputs**, then there are possible **2<sup>n</sup> input patterns**.

## **LAB 10:**

The challenge in the lab is to apply the contents we have learned from the course up to this time as well as debugging skills to implement a software for the traffic light system.

1. **Ports Initialization:**<br>
  I named ALL the necessary registers for ports initialization. Do it carefully. **Activate the clock**, then allow time for the clock to start. **Unlock GPIO** for each port by the magic number `0x4C4F434B`, then **allow changes to ports** and bits you use by setting the committed register. **Disable the analog** functionality since we won't use it. **Disable the PCTL** register. **Config the direction register** for I/O (`Input = 0` and `Output = 1`). **Disable alternate function** and **pull-up resistors**. Finally, **enable digital** I/O for ports and bits we are going to use.<br>
  Important, remember to set `PCTL = 0`. I mistakenly set PCTL (port control) to be equal to another number, and the automatic grading machine aborted my program.

2. **SysTick Initialization:**<br>
  Initialize the SysTick timer, then create a standard counting function and use that standard counting for main delay function.

3. **The hardest part - FSM declaration:**<br>
  The struct must have at least 4 elements, and we must output to the roads before indicating anything on the pedestrian. Every state must have a wait time. The last element, also the most important construction of an FSM, is state transition array. Draw a table with possible inputs, then write possible outputs based on the input and the current state. For references, I made this table below. Remember that **the FSM declaration and the table are EXACTLY the same things**.<br>
  ![fsm-table](/images/ut-6-03x-lab-10/fsm-table.jpg)

The order of the code segments in `while (1)` infinite looping must be:<br>
**roads outputs ~> pedestrian outputs ~> wait ~> get inputs ~> state transition**

## **CODE:**

Note that to be able to run and grade the labs, you have to follow the [software requirements](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/blob/master/software_requirements.pdf). Unfortunately, the software and the course don't support Linux. However, if you follow the official instruction from [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/LaunchPad/software.html#tabs), you can upload and run your program on the LaunchPad.

The code is a bit long, so I'm only showing my FSM initialization here. In order to view the full code, [go to my project folder on GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/tree/master/lab_10_traffic_light).

```c
struct FiniteStateMachine {     // represents a state of the FSM
    unsigned short port_b_out;  // ouput of Port B for the state (cars output)
    unsigned short port_f_out;  // output of Port F for the state (pedestrian output)
    unsigned short wait;        // time to wait when in this state
    unsigned char  next[5];     // next state array
};

// Shortcuts to refer to the various states in the FSM array
#define GO_SOUTH        0
#define WAIT_SOUTH      1
#define GO_WEST         2
#define WAIT_WEST       3
#define GO_WALK         4
#define HURRY_WALK_1    5

#define OFF_WALK_2      8
#define HURRY_WALK_3    9
#define OFF_WALK_3      10
#define NUM_STATES      11

// FSM declaration
typedef const struct FiniteStateMachine STATE[NUM_STATES] = {
    // 0) Go South
    {
        0x21, 0x02, 3000,
        { GO_SOUTH, GO_SOUTH, WAIT_SOUTH, WAIT_SOUTH, WAIT_SOUTH }
    },
    // 1) Wait South
    {
        0x22, 0x02,  500,
        { GO_WEST, GO_WEST, GO_WEST, GO_WALK, GO_WEST }
    },
    // 2) Go West
    {
        0x0C, 0x02, 3000,
        { GO_WEST, WAIT_WEST, GO_WEST, WAIT_WEST, WAIT_WEST }
    },
    // 3) Wait West
    {
        0x14, 0x02,  500,
        { GO_SOUTH, GO_SOUTH, GO_SOUTH, GO_WALK, GO_WALK }
    },
    // 4) Go Pedestrian
    {
        0x24, 0x08, 3000,
        { GO_WALK, HURRY_WALK_1, HURRY_WALK_1, GO_WALK, HURRY_WALK_1 }
    },
    // 5) Hurry Pedestrian 1
    {
        0x24, 0x02,  250,
        { OFF_WALK_1, OFF_WALK_1, OFF_WALK_1, OFF_WALK_1, OFF_WALK_1 }
    },
    // 6) Off Pedestrian 1
    {
        0x24, 0x00,  250,
        { HURRY_WALK_2, HURRY_WALK_2, HURRY_WALK_2, HURRY_WALK_2, HURRY_WALK_2 }
    },
    // 7) Hurry Pedestrian 2
    {
        0x24, 0x02,  250,
        { OFF_WALK_2, OFF_WALK_2, OFF_WALK_2, OFF_WALK_2, OFF_WALK_2 }
    },
    // 8) Off Pedestrian 2
    {
        0x24, 0x00,  250,
        { HURRY_WALK_3, HURRY_WALK_3, HURRY_WALK_3, HURRY_WALK_3, HURRY_WALK_3 }
    },
    // 9) Hurry Pedestrian 3:
    {
        0x24, 0x02,  250,
        { OFF_WALK_3, OFF_WALK_3, OFF_WALK_3, OFF_WALK_3, OFF_WALK_3 }
    },
    // 10) Off Pedestrian 3:
    {
        0x24, 0x00,  250,
        { GO_WEST, GO_SOUTH, GO_WEST, GO_SOUTH,  GO_SOUTH }
    }
};
```

## **SIMULATOR TESTING:**

In order to make the automatic grading machine run faster, adjust the delay time of each state to be less than 100 milliseconds.

## **REAL-BOARD TESTING:**

On the real board, the delay should be long for realistic perception, about 500ms to 3000ms.
