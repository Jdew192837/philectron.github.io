## **OVERVIEW:**

In the past when people had not yet invented the television, movie theaters used a very long ribbon of static images and rolled it very fast to create an illusion of a video clip. The device that helped them make movies using that method is called **Zoetrope**. Today, I'm gonna use the Arduino and a DC motor to simulate how Zoetrope works.

## **L293D H-BRIDGED INTEGRATED CIRCUIT:**

The key to controlling the DC motor in this project is the **H-bridge IC**. It's called **integrated circuit** because there are many tiny circuits inside it, sometimes identical ones. IC makes the circuit tidier and helps the wiring much easier. For instance, in this project, we can have the full control of the DC motor using this IC alone, whereas we had to use a MOSFET and a diode to operate the motor in [the previous project]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/arduino/2016/08/13/arduino-projects-book-project-09/).

There is a variety of ICs, so understanding the structure of the one we want to use is crucial. In fact, **we must look at the datasheet of an IC to know what exactly it does**. Here is important information I snipped from the sheet

![ic-pins](/images/arduino-projects-book-project-10/ic-pins.png)

The figure on the left shows the pin structure of the 20-pin IC; I don't use it, so I just ignore it. I'm using the 16-pin IC with 8 pins on each side. This structure can be divided into 4 identical parts. They are identical and have the same functions: input, output, and ground.

- `ENABLE 1` **is responsible for powering up the left bus which contains Circuit 1 and Circuit 2;** `ENABLE 2` **powers the right bus which contains circuit 3 and circuit 4.** This time we connect `~9` to `ENABLE 1` and leave the `ENABLE 2` alone because we only use the left bus.
- Since we plan to control the **direction** of the DC motor, we can hook one lead of the motor to `OUTPUT 1` and the other lead to `OUTPUT 2`. **Circuit 1 and Circuit 2 act like a polarity-controlled diode, which means they can change the one-way direction of the current according to `INPUT 1` and `INPUT 2`**. If `INPUT 1 = HIGH` and `INPUT 2 = LOW`, the current will flow from `OUTPUT 1` to `OUTPUT 2`, resulting in the motor spinning in one direction; the vice versa is also true, resulting in the motor spinning in another direction.
- **V<sub>s</sub>** should be connected to `+9V` because the motor draws a lot of energy, whereas the **V<sub>ss</sub>** should be connected to `+5V` of the Arduino.

For more information, see the [IC data sheet](https://github.com/philectron/arduino/blob/master/data_sheets/st_L293D_IC.pdf).

## **PULSE-WIDTH MODULATION (PWM):**

Pulse-width modulation is to modulate the width of the pulse. We can lengthen or shorten the `HIGH` duration of a signal without changing its frequency. For full information about PWM and `analogWrite`, please visit [Arduino's official tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM).

## **CIRCUIT:**

As usual, here is the schematic:

![schematic](/images/arduino-projects-book-project-10/schematic.png)

And this is the virtual layout of my breadboard:

As always, they are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/pcb/tree/master/arduino_repo/zoetrope). Finally, this is how I wired my circuit:

## **USING:**

There should have been a colorful pinwheel with a black ribbon standing on it and a ribbon of static images inside, but I messed up the ribbons. So, I just wanted my project to be simple.
