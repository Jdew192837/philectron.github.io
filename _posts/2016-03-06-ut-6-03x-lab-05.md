In this blog, I'll go through lab 05 of UT.6.03x - Functions in C. I kept reminding myself of going back to Arduino, yet here I am. I actually enrolled in the course and so I had to follow its deadline so that I could get my work done and earn a certificate. For now, I'll be playing around with the Tiva C-Series LaunchPad. I think I'll come back to Arduino after a while.

## **OVERVIEW:**

Lab 5 focuses on C programming at an introductory level. First, the lectures talked about **flowcharts** and **history of C**. I recommend skimming through the history of C and concentrating more on the flowchart since it helps people acquire computational thinking. The second thing we need to know is **input/output statement**, code organizing, **operators**, and **data types**. Next, they talked about **functions** in C, **conditional branching**, and **loop** in C. These are some of the most important elements of programming.

Alright, let's take a look at my lab in this chapter.

## **CODE:**

Note that to be able to run and grade the labs, you have to follow the [software requirements](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/blob/master/software_requirements.pdf). Unfortunately, the software and the course don't support Linux. However, if you follow the official instruction from [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/LaunchPad/software.html#tabs), you can upload and run your program on the LaunchPad.

See below for my code in main.c, or view the project folder on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/ut-6-03x/tree/master/lab_05_functions_in_c).

    if ((l < 3) || (w < 3) || (l > 20) || (w > 20)) { // out of range cases
        return 0;                                     // area = 0

## **REAL-BOARD TESTING:**

Grading on the real board is a little bit different from previous labs, but I'll show the process on the following video:
