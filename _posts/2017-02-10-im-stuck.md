I've assembled the circuit for the fifteenth project of the Arduino Projects Book. However, the project requires me to have an external circuit, specifically a playback audio circuit. Hmm... I don't have it, so I think I'm stuck here. I'll find a way to fix this, or I will find a new circuit that satisfies the requirements (I prefer option 2). G'day!
