excerpt: Hello there! Iâ€™m back!
---

Hello there! I'm back, and I'm currently blogging my lab progress on [UTAustinX: UT.6.03x Embedded Systems - Shape the World](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-world-utaustinx-ut-6-03x). I will use the Texas Instruments Tiva C-Series Launchpad EK-TM4C123GXL. I hope it would be fun.

P/s: I'm still playing around with the Arduino. See ya soon in a new series!
