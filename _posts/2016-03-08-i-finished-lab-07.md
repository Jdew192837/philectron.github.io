excerpt: "I finished lab 07, but I'm too sleepy to write a blog."

I've finished lab 07, but I'm too sleepy to write a blog now. I'm done with lab 07 for about 20 minutes. There were a lot of subroutines, but each of them was fairly short. Additionally, I found out that the time delay on simulation and the real board were somewhat different.

I will post my lab 07 journal tomorrow. Bye!
