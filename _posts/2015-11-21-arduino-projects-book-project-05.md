Good evening! Today, I'll continue the next project in the Arduino Projects Book, Mood Cue. In this project, we will learn how to control a servo motor using a potentiometer. By assembling a small indicator on the rotor of the servo, we can get the servo to point to different angles.

## **PREPARATION:**

- 1 x Arduino

![arduino-uno](/images/arduino-uno.jpg)

- 1 x Breadboard

![breadboard](/images/breadboard.jpg)

- 8 x Jumper wires
- 2 x 100-microFarad capacitors
- 1 x Potentiometer
- 1 x Servo motor
- 3 x Male headers (sticking together)

![parts](/images/arduino-projects-book-project-05/parts.jpg)

The headers that come with the Arduino Starter Kit are a bit short on one side and too long on the other. So, I had to use my fingers to push the plastic cover down to the middle of the headers so that the headers would fit the female socket of the servo.

## **BUILDING THE CIRCUIT:**

The servo motor draws more current when it is in motion. This will cause a dip in voltage on the board. By placing a 100-microFarad capacitor across 5V and GND of the servo, we can smooth out any voltage changes that may occur.

Here is my schematic:

Here is my breadboard layout from [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/):

As always, these are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/pcb/tree/master/arduino_repo/mood_cue). Lastly, this is my circuit board:

## **THE CODE:**

In addition to starting the Serial Monitor and reading the analog and controlling the Servo Motor, `map()` is a function that helps remap a number from one range to another.

<p align="center"><font face="consolas"><b>map(value, from_low, from_high, to_low, to_high);</b></font></p>

A value of `from_low` will be mapped to `to_low`. A value of `from_high` will be mapped to `to_high`. A value in between `from_low` and `from_high` will be mapped to a different value between `to_low` and `to_high`. A great usage of this function is to map a value collected by a photocell (ranging between 0 and 1023) to a value that output to an RGB LED (ranging between 0 and 255): `red_led_val = map(red_photo_val, 0, 1023, 0, 255);` (remember the previous project?).

Next, we need to include the Servo library so that we can work on our servo motor easily. After we `#include <Servo.h>` and declare `Servo MyServo`, we provide the servo motor with `attach()` and `write()` methods.

<pre class="prettyprint c-html linenums:1">
#include <Servo.h>

Servo MyServo;

MyServo.attach(SERVO_PIN);  // the Arduino pin that controls the servo
MyServo.write(90);          // write the angle
</pre>

Finally, see below for my project 05 code, or [see it on GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/arduino/blob/master/mood_cue/mood_cue.ino).

// include Servo library for servo motors

    Serial.begin(BAUD_RATE);         // start the Serial Monitor
}

void loop() {
    // read & print potentiometer value
    pot_val = analogRead(POT_PIN);
    Serial.print("pot_val: ");
    Serial.print(pot_val);
    // map & print from pot value to angle
    angle = map(pot_val, 0, 1023, 0, 179);
    Serial.print(", angle: ");
    Serial.println(angle);
    // run the servo by the angle
    MyServo.write(angle);
    // delay to stabilize
    delay(15);
}

## **WRAP UP:**

`map()` is a great function which helps mapping a value from one range to another. The `<Servo.h>` is also a useful library as it makes servo control much easier. I didn't simulate the door's mood indicator because it was hard to glue the servo on the door with the Arduino controlling it from the inside (I would possibly have to drill a hole on the door for wiring). But anyways, it's been the fifth project of the Arduino Projects Book - Mood Cue.
