## **OVERVIEW:**

Today, I become a musician! I'll use light to control the piezo buzzer. It's going to be a fun project since the piezo produces some funny sound. The instrument which I'm building is called a theremin. It's time for the sixth project of the Arduino Projects Book - Light Theremin.

## **PARTS:**

- 1 x Arduino UNO

- 1 x Breadboard

![breadboard](/images/breadboard.jpg)

- 1 x Piezo buzzer
- 1 x Photocell
- 1 x Red LED (Optional)
- 1 x 220-ohm resistor (Optional)
- 1 x 10-kilohm resistor
- 7 x Jumper wires

## **BREADBOARD LAYOUT:**

It's quite easy to build the circuit. As usual, the photocell always goes with a 10-kilohm resistor, and the LED always goes with a 220-ohm resistor. We don't need any resistor for the Piezo, though.

Below are my schematic and virtual breadboard layout. See them on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/pcb/tree/master/arduino_repo/light_theremin).

Here is my real-board layout:

## **PIEZO BUZZER:**

A **piezo buzzer** is a small element that vibrates when it receives electricity. When it moves, it displaces air around it, creating sound waves.

Piezo only has 2 leads. One lead connects to a digital pin, and the other connects to ground.

## **ARDUINO CODE:**

There are new functions that will be used in this project, `millis()` and `tone()`.

<p align="center">
  <font face="consolas">
    <font color="28c6e4"><i>unsigned long</i></font> time =
    <font color="9f9f8f"> millis</font>();
  </font>
</p>

`millis()` is a time built-in function that reports how long the Arduino has been running since it was last powered on or reset, in **milliseconds**. In order to apply `millis()` into this project, I use a `while()` loop with a condition `millis() <= 5000`, which means 5 seconds since the Arduino has been running. Five seconds should be enough for calibrating the photocell.

<p align="center">
  <font face="consolas">
    <font color="9f9f8f">tone</font>(BUZZER_PIN, frequency, duration);
  </font>
</p>

`tone()` helps us make sound with the piezo buzzer. It takes **three arguments**: what **pin** to play the sound on (in this case pin 2), what **frequency** to play (determined by the pitch variable), and **how long** to play the note (let's try 20 milliseconds).

See below for my code, or view it on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/arduino/blob/master/light_theremin/light_theremin.ino).
