## **OVERVIEW:**

People protect their property in many different ways. One way they can do that is to equip fancy security systems. Those things are expensive, though. Therefore, in this project, we will use an Arduino, a piezo buzzer, and a servo motor to make a cheap security system to protect our valuable stuff.

A special thing in this project that interests me is the creative use of the piezo buzzer. Usually, we use the buzzer to make a sound as I demonstrated in [light theremin]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/arduino/2016/01/10/arduino-projects-book-project-06) and [keyboard instrument]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/arduino/2016/05/03/arduino-projects-book-project-07/). But now, we use it as a microphone. We are taking advantage of the processor's capability to read analog signals through its ADC. In this case, we transform the intensity of the sound we knock into a value in the range `0..1024`, in which `0` represents **0V**, and `1024` represents **5V** at the input of the six analog pins.

Because **the piezo buzzer is very sensitive to sound, we will use a 1-megaohm resistor** so that we don't have to have 100% accuracy on our knocks.

## **PARTS:**

- 1 x Arduino UNO

- 1 x Breadboard

- 1 x Piezo buzzer
- 1 x 1-megaohm resistor
- 1 x Servo motor
- 1 x 100-microFarad capacitor
- 1 x Switch
- 1 x 10-kilohm resistor
- 3 x LEDs (red, yellow, green)
- 3 x 220-ohm resistors
- Many jumper wires

## **CIRCUIT LAYOUT:**

When connecting the buzzer, note that there may be **a plus(+) on one lead, indicating VCC**. We should connect that lead to **+5V** of the Arduino, and **the other lead through the 1-megaohm resistor to A0 and GND**. If both leads of the buzzer are the same, we can plug the buzzer in the breadboard either way.

Also, the **VCC** lead, the **PULSE** lead, and the **GND** lead should be connected to **+5V**, **a PWM pin** (in this case ~9), and **GND** of the Arduino, respectively. Because it draws a lot of currents when moving, we must connect a 100-microFarad parallel to the servo.

Here is my schematic:

And this is my breadboard layout:

As always, the schematic and the breadboard layout are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/pcb/tree/master/arduino_repo/knock_lock). I built my circuit and put it in a box.

## **CODE:**

We first encounter function in this project. Instead of writing our code repetitively, we will only write those lines of code once in a function and call that function over and over again. Functions are good for us because we are not only able to **reuse** the code but also make our **main code more readable**.

See below for my code, or [view on my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/arduino/blob/master/knock_lock/knock_lock.ino).
