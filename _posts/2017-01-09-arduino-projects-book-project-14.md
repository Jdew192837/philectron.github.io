## **OVERVIEW:**

Happy new year! I ate and slept too much during the break. This time, I'll interact with the Arduino through a computer application. I will also introduce an Arduino-like IDE - Processing. By the way, we have only two more episodes until the end of this series - this one and the next one. So, I'm thinking about finding a new series to work on, or I'm just spending more time on DIY Arduino and Robot. Currently, I'm working for the FRC team of my school and having many AP courses running. I'm also studying for the final exam of semester 1\. That's a lot of work, but I'll try.

## **PARTS:**

- 1 x Arduino UNO

- 1 x Breadboard

- 1 x 10-kilohm rotary potentiometer
- 6 x jumper wires

## **INTRODUCTION TO PROCESSING:**

[Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE is an Arduino-like IDE. I think Processing is a combination of Java and Arduino. The IDE is 80% similar to the Arduino IDE, but it has a few more options. More importantly, Processing can compile and run a Java application on the computer.

You can download it [here](https://processing.org/download/). After installing Processing, customize it as you want, then we can create communication between our computer to the Arduino by a Java program. To understand more about the Processing syntax, please take a look at its [reference](https://processing.org/reference/).

## **CIRCUIT LAYOUT:**

We only need to know how to connect a potentiometer to an analog pin of the Arduino. The schematic and the virtual breadboard layout are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/pcb/tree/master/arduino_repo/tweak_the_arduino_logo).

## **ARDUINO CODE:**

Basically, we only need to write a program that read values from the potentiometer and then convert that value (which ranges from 0 to 1024) to right values for the Serial Monitor (0-255).

See below for my code on the Arduino IDE, or [view it on my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/arduino/blob/master/tweak_the_arduino_logo/tweak_the_arduino_logo.ino).

// Required hardware I/O connections
const byte POT_PIN = A0;     // potentiometer connected to A0

// Global constants
const int BAUD_RATE = 19200; // for serial monitor

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(BAUD_RATE);
}

void loop() {
    // potentiometer reads values from 0 to 1024
    // map it to 0-255 to speed up the communication
    Serial.write(analogRead(POT_PIN) / 4);
    delay(1); // stabilize the pot
}
</pre>

This time, I used `Serial.write()`, not `Serial.println()`. `Serial.println()` is to write the value after being formatted by the Arduino. The `Serial.write()` function returns the **raw** value from what the Arduino **actually reads**. We will want it to be raw so that our code in Processing can "cook" it :)

## **PROCESSING CODE:**

That's what I uploaded to my Arduino. Next step is to write a program on the computer so that my Arduino can communicate with it.

See below for my code on the Processing IDE, or [view it on my GitHub](https://github.com/philectron/arduino/blob/master/tweak_the_arduino_logo/tweak_the_arduino_logo.pde). Note that the `BAUD_RATE` in both programs **MUST BE THE SAME** (in this case, `19200`).

        background(bgcolor, 255, 255);

        // draw the Arduino logo
        image(logo, 0, 0);
    }

Once the program runs, it may be reacting slowly to the changing of the potentiometer value. Be patient.

## **USING:**

I struggled to get the background change its color. It reacted so slowly. Despite the fact that we can use the combination of Processing and Arduino to do other interesting stuff, I don't think serial communication (UART) is the way to go since [it only has a certain number of bits on the register to operate]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/ti-launchpad/2016/04/06/ut-6-03x-lab-11/).
